# Overview
The Calorie Calculator is a simple web-based tool designed to help users track their daily caloric intake and expenditure. The calculator allows users to input their meals, snacks, and exercise activities to determine whether they are in a caloric surplus or deficit. The tool provides a quick and easy way to monitor diet and exercise habits, helping users stay on track with their health goals.

# Features
Input Tracking: Users can input their calorie intake for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, as well as calories burned through exercise.
Caloric Surplus/Deficit Calculation: The calculator compares the total calories consumed with the calories burned and daily budget to determine whether the user is in a surplus or deficit.
Dynamic Feedback: The tool dynamically updates the user's status as "Surplus" or "Deficit" based on the input, providing visual feedback via a color-coded span element.
Form Clearing: After calculation, the input fields are automatically cleared to allow for fresh inputs.
How It Works
Input Sections:

Meals: Users can enter the calories consumed for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
Exercise: Users can enter the calories burned during exercise.
Calorie Budget: Users can set their daily calorie budget, which represents the total calories they plan to consume in a day.
Calculation Process:

The calculator adds up all the calories consumed across meals and snacks.
It then subtracts the total calories burned through exercise from the user's calorie budget.
The difference between the budgeted calories and the actual intake, adjusted for exercise, determines whether the user is in a caloric surplus or deficit.
Feedback Display:

The result is displayed to the user as either a "Surplus" or "Deficit," with the status highlighted in a span element.
This span element is color-coded based on the result, providing an immediate visual cue.
Form Reset:

After displaying the results, the input fields are cleared to allow users to enter new data for the next calculation.
Usage
Enter Caloric Intake:

Fill in the number of calories consumed for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and any snacks.
Enter Calories Burned:

Enter the calories burned through exercise.
Set Calorie Budget:

Input your daily calorie budget, which is the total number of calories you aim to consume.
Calculate:

Press the "Calculate" button to see if you are in a caloric surplus or deficit.
Review Results:

The calculator will display whether you're in a "Surplus" or "Deficit" and by how many calories.
The result is also visually highlighted with a color-coded span element.
Clear and Repeat:

After the calculation, the input fields are cleared, allowing you to start over for the next meal or day.
